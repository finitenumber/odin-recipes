    <h2>For a dish you can directly translate into English with the phrase “boiled beef,” you probably wouldn’t expect Nilagang Baka to be a delicious balance of flavors. From the soft and satisfying texture of baby bok choy to the ever tender and rich cubes of beef sirloin, this recipe only intermingles the best ingredients for an ever comforting dish. Perhaps one of the reasons why it is so popular is because like many other famous Filipino recipes, it puts together a good deal of meat, vegetables and stew.</h2>

    <p>One thing that can make or break a beef dish is your meat’s texture. A rough, hard-to-chew cut of beef can really put a damper on a meal. After all, this would distract you no matter how well-balanced the flavors of a dish might be. But at the same time, a perfectly soft and juicy beef cut can heighten up any dish. </p>
